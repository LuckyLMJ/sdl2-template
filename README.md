a game made in C/SDL2 for my final computer science project

## Compilation Instructions
### Windows
to compile, install [msys2](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2023-05-26/msys2-x86_64-20230526.exe), run 'pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain' in the terminal menu that opens, put the install path in your PATH, then open vscode and run the command mingw32-make in the terminal.
to make compilation easier, you can install the makefile extension for vscode, set the makefile path to mingw32-make, and then build through the extension.
